# Image-Captioning-using-CNNs-LSTMs


1. **Model Overview**: The project implements image captioning using a CNN (DenseNet201) for Feature extraction and an LSTM for Generating captions. Text preprocessing includes tokenization, encoding, and embedding to form input for the LSTM.
2. **Training**: The model is trained with batch-wise data generation, Combining image embeddings with Text embeddings to Predict captions. Adjustments to the architecture enhance performance.
3. **Inference and Evaluation:** The model generates captions during inference by Feeding image features and Word embeddings into the LSTM.
